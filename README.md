# 100-days-of-swiftui
The repository to keep all of Paul Hudson (@twostraws)'s projects for 100 Days of SwiftUI.

## Update: January 6th, 2020
The 100 Days of SwiftUI journey is complete.
The repository has been updated to show all the 19 projects and 7 milestone projects, sorted by the time they were first created.
Many of the projects have been updated in order to complete various challenges proposed during the journey.

Day 100 consisted of an exam covering all the lessons from the previous days.
I passed the exam with a score of **92%**, corresponding to the **merit** tier.
